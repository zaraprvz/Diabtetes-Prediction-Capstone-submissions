Step 1: Initial Project Ideas 
**House Price Prediction**

House price prediction is used to determine the value of residential properties based on a variety of characteristics or variables associated with them. The numerical dataset for house price prediction includes the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property size, number of storeys, year built, and distance from nearby facilities.The category elements include neighborhood or location, dwelling style, garage type, availability of facilities, and so on. I will be using data from kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques .

**Diabetes Prediction Dataset **

Many individuals with diabetes remain undiagnosed until they develop severe complications.Solution: A predictive model can help identify high-risk individuals based on their health data, enabling early diagnosis and treatment. Early detection allows for lifestyle changes and medical interventions that can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.The goal of developing a diabetes prediction model is to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes early on. By predicting the likelihood of diabetes, healthcare providers can take proactive measures to manage and treat the disease, ultimately improving patient health and quality of life.

**Movie Recommendation System **

Collaborative filtering is used in movie recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering is based on the concept that users who have previously liked comparable items are more likely to like them again in the future. The dataset contains information about users, movies, and user ratings. The MovieLens dataset is a popular alternative and is available in various sizes (e.g., MovieLens 100k, MovieLens 1M, and MovieLens 20M).









Step 3: Project Proposal 
# **Diabetes Prediction dataset **

Elevated blood sugar levels are the cause of diabetes, a disease that can harm the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and heart. Early diagnoses and proper care are crucial for preventing issues and improving the quality of life for people with diabetes.

 The issue is that proper and early prediction approaches are particularly important, as the prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally. Though reliable, traditional diagnostic techniques can be intrusive, take a long time, and frequently don't provide a diagnosis until the disease has started. The need for a prediction algorithm that can use readily available data to identify people at high risk of acquiring diabetes is urgent. Having a diabetes prediction model is essential. 

The aim of this project is to use machine learning techniques to construct a prediction model that can reliably estimate an individual's risk of getting diabetes based on demographic data and a collection of health markers. By assisting medical professionals in early detection and treatment, this model hopes to lessen the overall impact of diabetes.

The diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv file from the diabetes prediction dataset is the source of the data that will be utilized in this project on Kaggle. The objective of this project is to enable early detection and treatment, hence preventing diabetes-related complications. Reducing the need for longer stays in hospitals and treatments, thereby reducing lower healthcare costs overall. Informing people about their health risks will enable them to lead better lives and take preventative measures.

 	 Summing up, a  vital requirement in the healthcare sector is addressed by the creation of a diabetes prediction model based on machine learning. This project is to create a low-cost, non-invasive, and precise tool for early diabetes detection by utilizing widely available health data. This will improve patient outcomes and lessen the worldwide burden of this chronic illness.
